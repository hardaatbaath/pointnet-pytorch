# PointNet
This is the implementation of the paper [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593).  

The code has been written in python and further comments will be added to make the code more readable. I have used the ShapeNet dataset for this project.  

Thanks to [Issac Berrios](https://medium.com/@itberrios6) for his Medium Article on the same, and was a valuable resource in this implementation.
